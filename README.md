# Project Objective:
COVID-19 ,a viral infection which broke out in 2019 and has spread throughout the world infecting humans, both young and old. Countries had to resolve for lockdowns in order to contain this deadly virus spreading while finding medical solutions. Years and still counting, there are reports of people confirmed to be infected and dead as a result of the outbreak. Thehealth sector made recovery vaccines available to reduce the potrncy of thr virus. However, there are data of these reports of cases, deaths and recovery which are available and updated on daily basis. As an aspiring data analyst,cthis is my first analysis and  I have been able to learn to analyse these data- thanksto NG30daysoflearning. This analysis is just to provide an insight into the data provided for different countries. and regions in the world.
